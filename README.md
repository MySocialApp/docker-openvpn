# OpenVPN Docker container

[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/mysocialapp/docker-openvpn/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/mysocialapp/docker-openvpn)

You can find here a docker container we're using at [MySocialApp](https://mysocialapp.io) (iOS and Android social app builder - SaaS)

Why this image? Because there are too many unmaintained containers version of OpenVPN, I'd like to do it by myself, containing latest security fixes.
